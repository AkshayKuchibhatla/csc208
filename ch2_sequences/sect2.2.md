# Section 2.2 Exercises

## Problem 1

Consider the sequence $5,9,13,17,21,...$ with $a_1 = 5$.

1. Give the recursive definition for the sequence.
2. Give a closed formula for the $n$th term of the sequence.
3. Is 2013 a term in the sequence? Explain.
4. How many terms does the sequence $5,9,13,17,21,...,533$ have?
5. Find the sum: $5+9+13+17+21+ \cdot +533$ Show your work.
6. Use what you found above to find $b_n$, the $n^{nth}$ term of $1,6,15,28,45,...$, where $b_0 = 1$.

**Solution to part 1:** $a_n = a_{n-1} + 4$ with $a_0 = 5$.
