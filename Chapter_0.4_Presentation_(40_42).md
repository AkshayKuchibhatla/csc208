### Describing functions
Functions are abstract mathematical objects, but when we want to talk about them, we need to represent them.
**There are 4 main ways to describe, or represent, a function:**
1. Graphically
2. Numerically
3. Algebraically
4. Verbally

#### Graphical representation
In normal math, functions are continuous, so a function looks like a line. However, because in discrete math the numbers in the domain are each a set distance apart, fucntions appear as dots:

$f(x)$

#### Numerical
In normal math, functions can also be represented using a table. When functions are discrete, on the other hand, since one input clearly leads to one output, the relation is represented via arrows:

$$
f(x) 
x &rarr; y
1 &rarr; 7
2 &rarr; 8
3 &rarr; 9
$$
